= Volumes & Persistent Volumes
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:watch-terminal: Terminal 2
:file-watch-terminal: Terminal 3

Containers are ephemeral by definition, which means that anything that it is stored at running time is lost when the container is stopped.
This might cause problems with containers that need to persist their data, like database containers.

A Kubernetes volume is just a directory that is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. 
The concept is similar to Docker volumes, but in Docker you are mapping the container to a computer host, whereas in the case of Kubernetes volumes, the medium that backs it and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used.

Some of the volume types are:

* awsElasticBlockStore
* azureDisk
* cephfs
* nfs
* local
* empty dir
* host path

== Preparation

=== Namespace

:section-k8s: volumes
:set-namespace: myspace

Make sure the proper namespace `{set-namespace}` is created and context is set to point to it.

include::partial$namespace-setup-tip.adoc[]

include::partial$set-context.adoc[]

=== Watch

If it's not open already, you'll want to have a terminal open (call it *{watch-terminal}*) to watch what's going on with the pods in our current namespace

:section-k8s: volumes
include::partial$watching-pods-with-nodes.adoc[]

== Volumes

Let's start with two examples of `Volumes`.

=== EmptyDir

An `emptyDir` volume is first created when a Pod is assigned to a node and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node.
As the name says, it is initially empty.
All Containers in the same Pod can read and write in the same `emptyDir` volume.
When a Pod is restarted or removed, the data in the `emptyDir` is lost forever.

:quick-open-file: myboot-pod-volume.yml

Let's deploy a service that exposes two endpoints, one to write content to a file and another one to retrieve the content from that file.  Open `{quick-open-file}`

include::partial$tip_vscode_quick_open.adoc[]

[source, yaml]
.{quick-open-file}
----
include::example$myboot-pod-volume.yml[]
----
<.> Notice that this is a `Pod` and not a `Deployment`
<.> This is where this mount point will appear in the pod.  See below 
<.> This must match the name of a volume that we define, in this case it is defined right at the bottom of the file

In `volumes` section, you are defining the volume, and in `volumeMounts` section, how the volume is mounted inside the container.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f apps/kubefiles/myboot-pod-volume.yml
----

Then in our watch window we should see something like

[tabs]
====
{watch-terminal}::
+
--
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME         READY  STATUS             AGE  NODE
myboot-demo  0/1    ContainerCreating  9s   devnation
----
--
====

Once the pod is running, let's exec into the container:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -ti myboot-demo -- /bin/bash
----

And once `exec` 'd into the container, run the following commands: 

[tabs]
====
Container::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/appendgreetingfile
curl localhost:8080/readgreetingfile
----

Which should return

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Jambo
----

In this case, the `emptyDir` was set to `/tmp/demo` so you can check the directory content by running `ls`:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ls /tmp/demo
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
greeting.txt
----
--
====

==== EmptyDir Ephemerality

If you haven't already, close the container's shell:

[tabs]
====
Container::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
exit
----
--
====

And delete the pod:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete pod myboot-demo
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to wait until the pod is completely deleted before trying to deploy it again
====

Then if you deploy the same service again: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f apps/kubefiles/myboot-pod-volume.yml
----

And once in the `Running` state `exec` into the pod: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -ti myboot-demo -- /bin/bash
----

[tabs]
====
Container::
+
--

Let's list the contents of our mount point in our new pod

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ls /tmp/demo
----

You'll notice that the directory content is empty, meaning that the file we created with the last pod was destroyed when the pod was deleted

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
root@myboot-demo:/app# 
----

Exit the pod

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
exit
----

--
====

Now delete the pod.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete pod myboot-demo
----

==== EmptyDir Sharing in Pod

`emptyDir` is shared between containers of the same Pod.  Let's take a look at a deployment that creates two containers in the same pod that mount the same `emptyDir` volume.

:quick-open-file: myboot-pods-volume.yml
include::partial$tip_vscode_quick_open.adoc[]

Consider `{quick-open-file}`: 

[.console-output]
[source,yaml]
.{quick-open-file}
----
include::example$myboot-pods-volume.yml[]
----
<.> The first container in the pod is called myboot-demo-1 and mounts `demo-volume` at `/tmp/demo`
<.> The second container in the pod is called `myboot-demo-2` and mounts `demo-volume` at the same `/tmp/demo` point
<.> Both containers use the same exact image
<.> Notice that the second container needs to listen on a different port from the first since the containers share ports on the pod.  The `env` directive at this level only applies to the `myboot-demo-2` container
<.> The volume is defined only once but referenced by each container in the pod

Now let's create that deployment in the `{set-namespace}` namespace

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f apps/kubefiles/myboot-pods-volume.yml
----

And in our pod watch we should see

[tabs]
====
{watch-terminal}::
+
--
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes,+quotes"]
----
NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
myboot-demo   #2/2#    Running   0          4s
----

Notice the `2/2` ready status.  This represents the 2 containers in the pod definition
--
====

First, let's exec into the *second* container in the pod and start a watch on the mount point.  For this we'll open yet another terminal (*{file-watch-terminal}*) `exec` into the other container in the pod to run the `cat` command

[tabs]
====
{file-watch-terminal}::
+
--

include::partial$open-terminal-in-editor-inset.adoc[]

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -it myboot-demo -c myboot-demo-2 -- bash 
----

And then from inside the `myboot-demo-2` container in the pod, run the following command: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
watch -n1 -- "ls -l /tmp/demo && eval ""cat /tmp/demo/greeting.txt"""
----

Which will at first return

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
total 0
cat: /tmp/demo/greeting.txt: No such file or directory
----

--
====

Let's access into the *first* container in the main terminal and see if we can get it to create a file that the *second* container can see

[tabs]
====
Terminal 1::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -ti myboot-demo -c myboot-demo-1 -- /bin/bash
----

and generate some content to `/tmp/demo` directory.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/appendgreetingfile
----

And then show that the file exists and what its content is: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
ls -l /tmp/demo && echo $(cat /tmp/demo/greeting.txt) 
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
total 4
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 5 Jul 13 08:11 greeting.txt
Jambo
----

--
====

Meanwhile in *{file-watch-terminal}* you should see something like: 

[tabs]
====
{file-watch-terminal}::
+
--
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
total 4
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 5 Jul 13 08:11 greeting.txt
Jambo
----

Hit kbd:[CTRL+c] to exit the watch and then exit out of the `exec` to the pod

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
exit
----

Now, back in your terminal you can get the volume information from a Pod by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl describe pod myboot-demo
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Volumes:
  demo-volume:
    Type:       EmptyDir (a temporary directory that shares a pods lifetime)
    Medium:
    SizeLimit:  <unset>
----

--
====

==== Clean Up

include::partial$terminal-cleanup.adoc[tags=**;!*;term3;term-exec]

=== HostPath

:quick-open-file: myboot-pod-volume-hostpath.yml

A `hostPath` volume mounts a file or directory from the node's filesystem into the Pod.  Take a look at `{quick-open-file}`

include::partial$tip_vscode_quick_open.adoc[]

[source, yaml]
.{quick-open-file}
----
include::example$myboot-pod-volume-hostpath.yaml[]
----
<.> We're mounting the same location as before, but you can see that we define the volume as `hostPath` here instead of `emptyDir`
<.> `/mnt/data` is a location on the kubernetes `node` to which this pod gets assigned

In this case, you are defining the host/node directory where the contents are going to be stored.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f apps/kubefiles/myboot-pod-volume-hostpath.yaml
----

Now, if you describe the Pod, in volumes section, you'll see:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl describe pod myboot-demo
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Volumes:
  demo-volume:
    Type:          HostPath (bare host directory volume)
    Path:          /mnt/data
    HostPathType:
----


[tabs]
====
{file-watch-terminal}::
+
--
Let's open a terminal where we can watch the directory on the 'host' or the 'node'

include::partial$open-terminal-in-editor-inset.adoc[]


:mount-dir: /mnt/data
include::partial$watch-node-directory.adoc[]

--
====

[tabs]
====
Terminal 1::
+
--

include::partial$create-greeting-file.adoc[]

--
====

Meanwhile in the other terminal (*{file-watch-terminal}*) you should at the same time see the watch output change

[tabs]
====
{file-watch-terminal}::
+
--
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

Jambo
----
--
====

Notice that now the content stored in `/tmp/demo` inside the Pod is stored at host path `/mnt/data`, so if the Pod dies, the content is not lost.

But this might not solve all the problems as if the Pod goes down and it is rescheduled in another node, then the data will not be in this other node.

Let's see another example, in this case for an Amazon EBS Volume:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-ebs
spec:
...  
  volumes:
    - name: test-volume
      awsElasticBlockStore:
        volumeID: <volume-id>
        fsType: ext4
----

What we want you to notice from the previous snippet is that you are mixing things from your application (ie the container, probes, ports, ...) things that are more in the _dev_ side with things more related to the cloud (ie physical storage), which falls more in the _ops_ side.

To avoid this mix of concepts, Kubernetes offers some layer of abstractions, so developers just ask for space to store data (_persistent volume claim_), and the operations team offers the physical storage configuration.

==== Clean Up

include::partial$terminal-cleanup.adoc[tags=**;!*;term-exec]

== Persistent Volume & Persistent Volume Claim

A `PersistentVolume` (_PV_) is a Kubernetes resource that is created by an administrator or dynamically using `Storage Classes` independently from the Pod.
It captures the details of the implementation of the storage and can be NFS, Ceph, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` (_PVC_) is a request for storage by a user. 
It can request for a specific volume size or, for example, the access mode.

=== Persistent volume/claim with hostPath

:quick-open-file: demo-persistent-volume-hostpath.yaml

Let's use `hostPath` strategy, but not configuring it directly as volume, but using persistent volume and persistent volume claim. Check out `{quick-open-file}`:

include::partial$tip_vscode_quick_open.adoc[]

[source, yaml]
.{quick-open-file}
----
kind: PersistentVolume
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-persistent-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: pv-demo 
  capacity:
    storage: 100Mi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/persistent-volume"
----

Now, the `volume` information is not in the pod anymore but in the _persistent volume_ object.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f apps/kubefiles/demo-persistent-volume-hostpath.yaml 

kubectl get pv -w
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

my-persistent-volume                       100Mi      RWO            Retain           Available                                                   pv-demo                 5s
----

:mount-dir: /mnt/persistent-volume

Once the volume is established, let's update our file watch terminal to look in the volume's new location: `{mount-dir}`

[tabs]
====
{file-watch-terminal}::
+
--

Hit kbd:[CTRL+c] to exit out of the current watch

Then start a new watch

include::partial$file-watch-command.adoc[]
--
====

:quick-open-file: myboot-persistent-volume-claim.yaml

Then from the dev side, we need to claim what we need from the _PV_.
In the following example, we are requesting for *10Mi* space.  See `{quick-open-file}`:

include::partial$tip_vscode_quick_open.adoc[]

[source, yaml]
.{quick-open-file}
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:

spec:

  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:

      storage: 10Mi
----


[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f apps/kubefiles/myboot-persistent-volume-claim.yaml

kubectl get pvc -w
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME                 STATUS   VOLUME                 CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
myboot-volumeclaim   Bound    my-persistent-volume   100Mi      RWO            pv-demo        3s
----

:quick-open-file: myboot-pod-volume-pvc.yaml

The big difference is that now in the pod you are just defining in the `volumes` section, not the volume configuration directly, but the _persistent volume claim_ to use.  See `{quick-open-file}`:

include::partial$tip_vscode_quick_open.adoc[]

[source, yaml]
.{quick-open-file}
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myboot-demo
spec:

    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /tmp/demo
      name: demo-volume

  volumes:
  - name: demo-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: myboot-volumeclaim
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f apps/kubefiles/myboot-pod-volume-pvc.yaml

kubectl describe pod myboot-demo
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Volumes:
  demo-volume:
    Type:       PersistentVolumeClaim (a reference to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace)
    ClaimName:  myboot-volumeclaim
    ReadOnly:   false
----

Notice that now the description of the pod shows that the volume is not set directly but through a persistent volume claim.

include::partial$create-greeting-file.adoc[]

And as soon as we've done that we'll expect to see the following on the path on the node that the `PersistentVolume` maps to: 

[tabs]

==== Clean Up

include::partial$terminal-cleanup.adoc[tags=**;!*;term-exec;term3-ssh]

Once all is cleaned, run the following: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl get pvc
----

Results in:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

----

Even though the pod has been deleted, the PVC (and the PV) are still there and need to be deleted manually.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete -f apps/kubefiles/myboot-persistent-volume-claim.yaml
kubectl delete -f apps/kubefiles/demo-persistent-volume-hostpath.yaml
----

== Static vs Dynamic Provisioning

Persistent Volumes can be provisioned dynamically or statically.

Static provisioning allows cluster administrators to make *existing* storage device available to a cluster.
When it is done in this way, the PV and the PVC must be provided manually.

So far, in the last example, you've seen static provisioning.

The dynamic provisioning eliminates the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage. 
Instead, it automatically provisions storage when it is requested by users.
To make it run you need to provide a Storage Class object and a PVC referring to it.
After the PVC is created, the storage device and the PV are automatically created for you.
The main purpose of dynamic provisioning is to work with cloud provider solutions.

Normally, the Kubernetes implementation offers a default Storage Class so anyone can get started quickly with dynamic provisioning.
You can get information from the default Storage Class by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get sc
----

----
NAME            PROVISIONER             AGE
gp2 (default)   kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   31h
----

By default, when OpenShift is installed in a cloud provider, it automatically creates a Storage Class with the underlying persistent technology of the cloud.
For example in the case of AWS, a default Storage Class is provided pointing out to AWS EBS.
--
====

Then you can create a Persistent Volume Claim which will create a Persistent Volume automatically.  Use kbd:[CTRL+p] to open `demo-dynamic-persistent.yaml` quickly:

[source, yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myboot-volumeclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Mi
----

Since we've not specified any _storage class_ but there is one defined as the default, the _PVC_ implicitly refers to that one.  (You might consider comparing this pod definition to `myboot-persistent-volume-claim.yaml`)

Notice that the _PVC_ is in _Pending_ STATUS, because remember that we are creating dynamic storage and it means that while the _pod_ doesn't request the volume, the _PVC_ will remain in a pending state and the _PV_ will not be created.

[.console-input]

Notice that now the volume claim is  _Bound_ to a volume.

== Distributed Filesystems

It is important to notice that cloud-providers offer distributed storages so data is always available in all the nodes.
As you've seen in the last example, this storage class guarantees that all nodes see the same disk content.

For example, if you are using Kubernetes/OpenShift on-prem or if you don't want to relay to a vendor solution, there is also support for distributed filesystems in Kubernetes.
If that's the case, we recommend you use NFS, https://www.gluster.org/[GlusterFS ] or https://ceph.io/[Ceph].
